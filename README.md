# ielts-speaking-questions-creator-v1

Just created this for myself 🤦🏻 to practice IELTS speaking by selecting random topics 👶🏻. It's a bit sad that I've forgotten many things about HTML and CSS 😭, but fortunately, it works 🤡. I'll make improvements when I have some time 💪🏻🧑🏻‍💻.

---------------------------------------------------

📝 This is the initial draft of the project.

🔍 I will be sourcing the questions from the following link: https://www.bestmytest.com/ielts/speaking

💥 The concept is to randomly select a topic and a list of questions corresponding to the question set number of that topic for each part of the IELTS speaking test.

🚀 Currently, I am displaying only the topic number. I will soon update the feature to show both the topic names and questions.
